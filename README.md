# COVID-19-Detection-Device
To overcome the problem of the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a detector based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using X-ray images. The architecture in the CNN method is composed of 32 filters, 2 convection layers and 1 dense layer using the Python Programming language. The results of this technology trial are able to recognize the symptoms of COVID-19 accurately with an error rate reaching 9.27 e-4% and an accuracy value of 100%. So with this technology can make it easier to identify the symptoms of COVID-19 in patients with suspected.
